1. Make ready has no information on Active state
2. While registering as a guest, is profile picture mandatory ? No clear information
3. (Maybe ??) One more logic that states , guest cannot accept invitations to those events whose start time is in the past
4. Id-11 F1. When it says, request is reject and failure is returned, do we add a rejected request to join to the event, or not at all ?
5. Id-14 : What about the accepting the invitation that was declined before ??
